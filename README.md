# Bubble-Sort-Visualization

An animation, to visualize the bubble sort algorithm, using python's pygame module.

-> It is initially set to 120fps, to visualize better, you can change the variable FPS to 10 or whatever you find suitable, but while        doing so, reduce the no. of bars from variable TOTALBARS else the visual will take a hell lot of time to complete.
   
-> Also the height difference betweeen two consicuitive bars is set in variable STEP, initially set to 5 for 150 bars,for less number of 
   bars you can increase for better visuals.

You can visualize for upto 200 bars with STEP = 4 (Don't forget to increase FPS, else for 200 bars visuals will run for too long...)

Press ESC Key or the CROSS any time to quit...
