# Bubble-Sort-Visualization

An animation, to visualize the bubble sort algorithm, using python's pygame module.

It is initially set to 30fps, to visualize better, you can change the variable FPS to 10 or whatever you find suitable, but while doing
so reduce the no of bars from variable TOTALBARS else the sorting will take a hell lot of time to complete.
Also the height difference betweeen two consicuitive bars is set in variable STEP, initially set to 5 for 100 bars,for less number of 
bars you can increase for better visuals.
